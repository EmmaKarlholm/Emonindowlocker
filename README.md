# Emonindowlocker
Disables resizing of windows. Or more specifically, resizes windows back to their original size if you accidentally resize them yourself.

Requires [DisplayFusion](https://www.displayfusion.com/) to use.

## FunctionVersion ([Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmmaKarlholm/Emonindowlocker/refs/heads/main/FunctionVersion.cs))
This is a toggleable script where you can lock and unlock window resizing. Can be attached to window Titlebars or invoked using global hotkeys.

Please follow [DisplayFusion's documentation on Functions](https://www.displayfusion.com/Features/Functions/) for information on setting these behaviours.

## TriggerVersion ([Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmmaKarlholm/Emonindowlocker/refs/heads/main/TriggerVersion.cs))
This version is designed to be used with DisplayFusion Triggers to automatically lock a window on start-up. The script is set up for `notepad.exe` by default, but you are encouraged to change this to whichever program whose size you want to lock.

Please follow [DisplayFusion's documentation on Triggers](https://www.displayfusion.com/Features/Triggers/) for information on setting Triggers.
